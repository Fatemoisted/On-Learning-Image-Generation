# On Learning Image Generation

2022 marks a significant milestone for AIGC, featuring remarkable products like ChatGPT and MidJourney. While large language models continue to astonish the world, we must not overlook the strides made in image generation. The ability to produce personalized images and content across various media forms forms the cornerstone of AIGC's industrial pursuits, but it also introduces substantial potential threats to our daily lives.

The field of image generation has evolved over an extended period. While diffusion models appear to be at the forefront of this trend, it remains crucial to grasp the concepts of previous models. Furthermore, models centered on image generation often prove intricate, demanding a strong foundation in mathematics, which can deter newcomers like myself from approaching them with enthusiasm.

Hence, I have chosen to embark on a series of blog posts aimed at introducing key types of image generation models. For each model, I will also provide a practical implementation. This repository serves as a personal record of my journey into image generation, while also serving as a guide for newcomers seeking a concise path to delve into this field.

### Other information

The expriment in this repository will mainly use Cifar10 dataset provided by pytorch. All training will be done on a single Nvidia RTX 4060 GPU.
